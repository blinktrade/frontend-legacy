To cancel an open order go to “Buy or Sell” on the main menu. Select the order to be canceled from the “My orders” list and click "Cancel" next to the chosen order. Another option is to click on the "Order Book" and search for the order marked with your username and a red “x” next to it. Click on the order to cancel it.
